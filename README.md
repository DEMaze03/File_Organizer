# File_Organizer
 *A Python script to automatically organize the files in the Downloads, Documents, Pictures, and Videos directories of a user's PC.* 

- Implemented a Python script that categorizes files on my computer into separate folders based on their extension.
- The script utilizes the os library to iteratively locate and store all files in a directory in an array, ignoring hidden files. The stored files are then moved into separate folders based on the files’ extensions thanks to the shutil library. The process is iteratively repeated for the user’s Downloads, Documents, Photos, and Videos directories.
